##CSharpLanguageTests##

Test suite asserting on some of the eccentricities of the C# language. 

This repo is the place where I put unit tests (written for NUnit with FluentAssertions) against language features that I believe are subtle, and perhalps difficult to discover. The exact behaviour of enum's, the methods IOC containers employ in odd cercomstances, the results of Covariance and Contravariance, and the sepcifics of type inference are a few of the typical things I like to assert on in these test fixtures. You might say these tests serve as a fixture against the language itself.
